# TxPath Revision Preparation

**About this Repo**

TxPath is in the midst of a revision to support compatibility with SQL Render.  This repo brings together the code from all sections of TxPath.  THIS REPO DOES NOT ITSELF CONSTITUTE A RUNNABLE APPLICATION.

**Sections**
TxPath has three main components:

* UI for defining studies  (Study Definition UI Files) - These currently live in Atlas panacea branch
* UI for viewing results  (Results UI files) - These currently are standalone
* APIs for study definition, execution, and result viewing (WebAPI files) - These currently live in WebAPI OHDSI-59 branch

**Community Objectives**
* Modify TxPath WebAPI files to support latest version of WebAPI and SqlRender
* Deploy full UI as standalone application pending determination of optimal location for TxPath within Atlas.
